# My Cypress Automation
This project is a foundational framework where I use tools, frameworks, and software test automation resources on a sample project — "Orange HRM" — provided by the company Orange HRM for testing and learning purposes.
The project includes login automation and basic yet dynamic user screen tests (MyInfo) as an introduction to the world of QA Software Engineering. It utilizes baseURL objects, selectors, objects, and pageObjects, incorporating testing best practices and covering multiple levels of tests and features. It also includes tests with randomized data using CacheJS.

Tools used:
1. Visual Studio
2. NodeJS
3. Cypress
4. CacheJS
5. GitHub
6. CSS Selectors
7. JavaScript

This project utilizes Cypress to automate the testing of a login feature and a user update feature. 
Cypres is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows develpers to write tests and execute them in a real browser.
